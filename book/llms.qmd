# Understanding Large Language Models {.unnumbered}

A brief introduction to Large Language models (LLMS) by way of ChatGPT,
this guide will demystify both. Through hands-on activities and case
studies, you'll explore potential challenges and opportunities for the
use of LLMs and ChatGPT in current and future library services.

## Overview

### What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?

A large language model (LLM) is a type of **machine learning model**
that can perform **natural language processing** tasks such as
generating and classifying text, answering questions, and translating
text.

If your eyes just crossed reading that sentence, no wonder, there's a
lot of terminology and jargon to unpack there in that one little
sentence. Let's go back a few steps and take it a little slower!

It helps to first understand a little bit about what machine learning
is. **Machine learning (ML)** is a core technology that underpins a lot
of work in artificial intelligence work today. Artificial intelligence
is actually a broad field that encompasses the development of systems
and machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human
intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and
perception, and...chatting!

[**[Natural Language Processing
(NLP)]{.underline}**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
is a specialised area within artificial intelligence (AI) that looks
specifically at the challenges of processing and understanding human
language (another is Computer Vision (CV) which is, on the other hand,
concerned with helping computers process and understand imagery in the
vein of human vision). NLP plays a vital role in enhancing the
capabilities of AI systems by working to make them more capable of
natural and effective interaction with humans.

NLP involves the development of algorithms, models, and systems for
analysing, understanding and extracting meaningful information from
textual data representing human language. The field relies heavily on
the use of machine learning to make sense of our complex textual data,
which might come from literature, historical documents, articles,
twitter, wikipedia, you name it!

Machine learning involves the development of [algorithms]{.underline}
and [models]{.underline} that allow computers to learn patterns and
relationships from data and make predictions on new data. Instead of
being explicitly programmed for specific tasks, ML algorithms use data
to learn and improve their performance over time.

A **machine learning algorithm** is designed to recognize patterns,
relationships, and trends in data and will adjust their internal
parameters based on examples to improve their performance over time.

A **machine learning model** represents what was learned by a machine
learning algorithm. The model that's created in the process and saved
after running a machine learning algorithm on training data and
represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data
structures required to make predictions on new data.

So back to our definition:

A large language model (LLM) is a type of **machine learning model**
that can perform **natural language processing** tasks such as
generating and classifying text, answering questions, and translating
text.

Language models are a type of machine learning model designed to predict
the likelihood of a sequence of text, which means that they can be set
up to predict the most likely way to continue a conversation. The models
behind ChatGPT are large, complex neural networks that have been exposed
to an enormous amount of text from books, articles, websites, and more.
These models have learned something about patterns in grammar and word
meaning, including the way that meaning arises contextually across
multiple sentences and multiple turns in a conversation. When you ask
ChatGPT a question, you are presenting the model with new information it
tries to make a prediction on, in this case, it tries to generate a
response that matches the pattern of conversation. Large language models
are trained on massive amounts of text data and are essentially the
backbone of NLP today. There are and have been for many years, large
language models out there actually but ChatGPT has currently caught the
popular imagination because of its publicly available interface and
remarkable performance.

### What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a platform providing an interface specifically to the large
language models developed by OpenAI. The GPT stands for
[[**G**enerative]{.underline} [**P**re-Trained]{.underline}
[**T**ransformers]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer)
which is just a fancy way of saying that the models you are chatting
with have already been trained on a lot of data.

It\'s a chatbot essentially designed to generate human-like text
responses based on the input it receives. Or some say to think of it as
a fancy predictive text generator. You ask questions or give prompts,
and it provides responses in natural language, or rather, estimates what
should come next in a conversation.

#### What ChatGPT is NOT:

-   [Google Search Box:]{.underline} Unlike Google, ChatGPT doesn\'t
    search the internet for information. Instead, it generates responses
    based on a massive dataset it was trained on. This training dataset
    includes large segments of text sampled from the internet at a
    specific point in time, and so can reflect language describing
    content on the internet, but it doesn\'t have real-time access to
    the internet. When ChatGPT answers a question, it isn't actually
    looking up information and then composing that information into a
    response; it\'s just making an estimation of a response based on
    patterns it has seen. So, when you ask it factual questions,
    especially ones with common answers or phrases, it might give you an
    answer that sounds right but remember this is because it's mimicking
    what it has seen in its training data. Think of it perhaps as a very
    smart parrot, sometimes \'repeating\' things it has seen before.

-   [Human Mind]{.underline}: ChatGPT is not a human; it\'s a machine
    learning model. It doesn\'t understand or reason like a human. It
    generates evidently linguistic responses based on patterns it
    learned from text data.

#### How ChatGPT Generates Responses:

-   [Language Modelling]{.underline}: So ChatGPT models are members of
    this class of models we're talking about: "large language models"
    (LLMs). A machine learning model represents what was learned by a
    machine learning algorithm. The model is created and saved after
    running a machine learning algorithm on training data and represents
    the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures
    required to make predictions on new data. Language models are
    designed to predict the likelihood of a sequence of text, which
    means that they can be set up to predict the most likely way to
    continue a conversation. The models behind ChatGPT are large,
    complex neural networks that have been exposed to an enormous amount
    of text from books, articles, websites, and more. These models have
    learned something about patterns in grammar and word meaning,
    including the way that meaning arises contextually across multiple
    sentences and multiple turns in a conversation. When you ask ChatGPT
    a question, it tries to generate a response that matches these
    patterns.

-   [Contextual Understanding]{.underline}: ChatGPT also looks at the
    context of the question you ask, including what's happened so far in
    your conversation and any instructions or details you offer about
    how it should respond. It tries to understand the context and
    generate a response that is contextually relevant, which can make
    its answers seem quite accurate.

-   [Existing Knowledge:]{.underline} It can recall and blend
    information it has observed in its training data. So, when you ask a
    factual question, it can sometimes generate a response that seems
    factual because it has encountered similar information during
    training. But, it can also make mistakes or provide information that
    is outdated or biassed because it doesn\'t have the ability to
    verify the accuracy of what it says, and it is influenced by any
    views inherent in its training data, whether they are right or
    wrong. It\'s like the parrot repeating something it heard: it can\'t
    check if what it\'s saying is true or up-to-date. That\'s why it\'s
    important to double-check information output by ChatGPT with
    reliable sources, especially when using ChatGPT for research or
    critical tasks.

-   [User Feedback Loop]{.underline}: ChatGPT models like the latest
    [[GPT-4 (openai.com)]{.underline}](https://openai.com/gpt-4) have
    been tuned and improved over time with user feedback, as part of a
    model training process known as "reinforcement learning". So for
    example, when users request things like python code, and try it out,
    users provide feedback on whether or not it worked. This feedback
    helps the model get better at generating code that is more likely to
    work.

#### When best to use ChatGPT:

-   [Idea Generation]{.underline}: ChatGPT can help brainstorm ideas for
    projects, essays, or creative endeavours. For example, you can ask
    it for ideas on new business ventures, book plots, or marketing
    campaigns.

-   [Thesaurus and Rephrasing]{.underline}: It\'s excellent for finding
    synonyms, rephrasing sentences, or improving the clarity of your
    writing. You can ask it to provide alternative words or rewrite a
    paragraph for better readability.

-   [Creative Writing]{.underline}: ChatGPT can assist with creative
    writing tasks, including writing short stories, poems, or generating
    dialogues for characters.

-   [Some Learning and Explanation]{.underline}: It can provide
    explanations and answers to questions on a wide range of very
    general topics, making it useful for learning new concepts or
    understanding complex ideas. But again, always best to double check
    against other trusted resources.

-   [Language Translation]{.underline}: ChatGPT can offer some basic
    translation assistance, such as translating phrases or short
    sentences between languages.

-   [Generating code snippets]{.underline}: It may not produce highly
    complex or critical code reliably but you can use it as a starting
    point for some common coding tasks.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Querying structured data]{.underline}: ChatGPT can provide outputs
    in the form of data structures including for instance SQL queries
    and JSON. So for instance if we have an SQL database with
    information about the content of a corpus, we can prompt ChatGPT to
    output queries that would apply to that database. We can then begin
    to imagine an interface where a non-expert user could make such a
    query using their own natural language, and ChatGPT could provide a
    connection with the structured data. This is sometimes referred to
    as "function calling" in the ChatGPT literature.

## Hands On Activity

For this activity we'll primarily use the freely available [[ChatGPT
(openai.com)]{.underline}](https://openai.com/chatgpt) interface. It's
also possible for those who may have more advanced skills to investigate
using the API directly though it's not free.

### Writing prompts

To get a useful response from ChatGPT, "prompting" is key. If you only
ask a simple question, you may not be happy with the results and decide
to dismiss the technology too quickly, but today's purpose is to have a
deeper play in order to develop our critical thinking and information
evaluation skills, allowing us to make informed decisions about
utilising tools like ChatGPT in our endeavours.

Some best practices for writing a good prompt (helpful hints/tips
gleaned from the readings above):

-   Give the context. The more you explain the ins and outs of what you
    want ChatGPT to do, the more relevant your answer will be. For
    example, "You are an expert in \[fill in the blank for your
    topic\]."

-   Be very specific and concrete about what you want it to do (and
    equally, what you don't want it to do). For instance you may want to
    specify word count, how many items you'd like in a list, tone of
    voice, etc.

-   Give clear instructions on what the output should look like, and be
    simple and concise in your language.

-   Provide examples. Much like a human, ChatGPT often understands best
    when you provide an example for it to work with, especially if you
    want it to produce something that closely resembles something you've
    seen online.

-   Ask ChatGPT to "act like" someone: Sometimes, it can help to start
    your prompt by asking ChatGPT to "act like" a certain type of person
    that would be particularly well-placed to respond to the query
    you\'re posing.

If you're not satisfied with any part of the answer, you can keep
building on it, asking ChatGPT to revise it in any way you like as it
will continue on from previous enquiries in a session. (If you'd rather
it not do that you can add "Please ignore all previous instructions" to
start a prompt fresh). To learn more about prompting, there is a free
online course: [[Learn
Prompting]{.underline}](https://learnprompting.org/).

### Exploratory activities:

-   Have a play generating responses to some of the below questions (or
    come up with your own)!

-   Critically evaluate the responses you receive from ChatGPT.

    -   Is the information/response credible?

    -   Are there any biases in the responses?

    -   Does the information align with what you know from other
        sources?

-   Consider your findings, the strengths and weaknesses, ethical
    considerations and challenges of using AI tools such as this.
