# **TOPIC GUIDES** {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Written by [LIBER](https://libereurope.eu/) professionals working in research libraries across Europe, the aim of each guide is to provide a gentle and concise introduction to practical applications of digital scholarship and data science to the work of libraries today, and share personal recommendations for useful tutorials, recommended reading, and communities of practice to help colleagues on their learning journey.  

## How to use DS Topic Guides

This resource has a dual purpose; it is written as a tool for self-study and quick reference, but also as a guide for individuals and institutions interested in establishing their own local training programmes. 

### Self-study & Quick Reference

As a self-study resource, we hope it can serve as a useful first point of entry into complex topics in digital scholarship and data science and their application in the library world. It is not meant to be completed in any particular order, rather, learners are invited to jump in and out of individual topic guides as personal curiosity or practical need dictates.

Each **Topic Guide** is designed to make it easy to quickly find the information you might need: 

- Introduction to the topic
- Relevance to the library sector (case studies/use cases)
- Hands-on activities and other self-guided tutorial(s)
- Recommended reading & viewing
- Finding Communities of Practice

### Use in teaching or your own local training programme

The materials here can also be utilised in group study, as part of a reading group or even a hands-on workshop. See our Topic Guide on how to [Start your own training programme](https://libereurope.github.io/ds-essentials/dstp.html) for some tips and tricks from British Library Digital Research Team colleagues on utilising the materials referenced here at your own library or within your network.
